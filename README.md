# STA437 Final Project — Code & Reproducibility

This repository contains the complete R code and dataset used for the STA437 Final Project.

All analyses, figures, and tables presented in the report can be reproduced by running the scripts included here.  
Note that the 3D PCA visualization is not shown in the knitted PDF because the corresponding code chunk is set to `eval = FALSE`.
